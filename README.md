<h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    JackBlack is my version of a very popular casino game, BlackJack.BlackJack or 21 is a 
    common card game played in casinos. The goal of the game is to draw cards to obtain a 
    value of 21. Your opponent will be the dealer who is also trying to reach
    21. However, if the value of your hand exceeds 21, you automatically lose. This is called 
    "busting".
